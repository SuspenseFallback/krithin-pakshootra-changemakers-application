            Hello! I am Krithin Jay Pakshootra, and I am a Year 9 student at
            DCIS. <br />
            <br />I have always had a passion for computers ever since I was a
            kid. However, when I was 10, my dad introduced me to programming and
            for 3 years now I have been programming websites, AI, python
            programs, and lots of other cool stuff!
            <br />
            <br />
            When I joined DCIS, one of my aims was to become a member of one of
            the Changemakers committees, and I successfully joined the Digital
            Culture and Learning Committee. Now, I am trying to aim higher and
            become the lead of the Learning and Digital Committee.
            <br />
            <br />
            With my knowledge of computer science, my experience in the
            committee previously and the values that I show in my day-to-day
            life, I think I am a great fit for the lead/member of the Learning
            and Digital Committee.
